It is with the greatest respect and appreciation that I wish to
thank my supervisor, Dr. Anthony Lau, for his guidance
during the preparation of this thesis, and for his advice
and encouragement throughout my graduate program.

I also wish to thank Dr. Ali-Amir Husain, Peter Pivovarov, Parantap 
Shukla, Benjamin Willson, and especially Shawn Desaulniers, to whom
I am greatly indebted.

Finally, I would like to thank my family and friends for their unfailing 
faith and support.
