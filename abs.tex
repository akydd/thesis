%A semigroup $G$ together with a Hausdorff topology for which multiplication
%in $G$ is separately continuous is called a semitopological
%semigroup.
%$G$ has a jointly continuous action on a topological Hausdorff space $X$ when
%A jointly continuous action of $G$ on a topological Hausdorff space $X$ is
%a jointly continuous  map $(a,x) \mapsto ax$ from $G\times X$ into $X$, such that
%$(ab)x = a(bx)$ for all $a$, $b\in G$ and $x\in X$, and such that the map 
%$x\mapsto ax$, from $X$ 
%into $X$, is continuous for each $a\in G$.

%The last chapter of this thesis investigates fixed point properties
%of the action of a locally compact group $G$ on a locally convex 
%topological 
%space $X$.

%We define an action of the dual space of norm closed subspaces of 
%$CB(G)$,
%on the dual space of norm closed subspaces
%of $CB(X)$.

Let a semitopological semigroup $G$ have a jointly continuous left action
on a topological Hausdorff space $X$.  In this setting, several
subspaces of $CB(G)$ have analogues in $CB(X)$.
We define an action of the duals of these subspaces on
the duals of their analogues.  This action is an analogue to
the first Arens product.
We consider the topological center of this action
of $LUC(G)^*$ on $LUC(G,X)^*$.
As an application,
we examine the relationship between almost $G$-periodic points,
$G$-minimal sets, and elements of $\beta X$ that are in the
support of a $G$-invariant measure for $\beta X$.

We use Day's fixed point theorem to show the existence of an invariant
measure on coset spaces of certain groups.
When $H$ is a closed subgroup of a topological group $G$, we define a new fixed point property 
for the pair $(G:H)$ that is
equivalent to Eymard's stronger fixed point property for $(G:H)$.
